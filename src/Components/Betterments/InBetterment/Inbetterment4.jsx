          <p>Pregnancy Series: Preconception <br />
              Welcome to the Preconception Phase of Fitness Blender’s Pregnancy Series! This one-of-a-kind series serves as a helpful guide for how to safely and confidently exercise before becoming pregnant. We have compiled workouts, daily guides, and expert articles to provide you with a balanced routine for this important part of your pregnancy journey.
<br /><br />
              Approach and Difficulty Level <br />
              While conception is a different experience for everyone, one thing is certain: exercise helps with fertility.
<br /><br />
              According to the Australian Government Department of Health and the Victorian Government Department of Health, regular physical activity can improve fertility and reduce symptoms of anxiety/depression and self esteem. International guidelines recommend at least 30 minutes of moderate intensity physical activity — such as brisk walking, gardening, or dancing — on most days of the week for those who are attempting to conceive. For this reason, we’ve kept the difficulty level around 3 (out of 5) to reflect the best research, and included strength training, cardio, core/Pilates, stretches, and total body work to give you the best chance for success. There are 5 days programmed into this phase, but we highly encourage you to listen to your body and complete it in your own time.
<br /><br />
              How to Use This Phase <br />
              The Preconception Phase lasts 1 week and contains 5 workouts. The expectation is to work at your own pace rather than complete all workouts in one week. These workouts illustrate best practices at this stage of your journey, but feel free to use them over and over or swap in a similar workout to add variety.
<br />
              Equipment <br />
              For most workouts in this phase, you’ll only need your own bodyweight, a mat, and dumbbells. Some optional items that make an appearance are resistance bands and an exercise step.
