                <div className='text-xl font-bold text-left'>Overview</div><br /><br />

                <p className='font-bold'>This is a short and efficient total body strength workout that will naturally start to feel like cardio, especially with the 30-second cardio bookend to each round. We complete 5 strength-based intervals followed by one shorter cardio interval and will make our way through that 3 times.
<br /><br />



                    Equipment: Range of medium to heavy dumbbells (I’m using 9, 15, and 18 lbs) and a mat.
                    <br /><br />
                    Being that we will complete each exercise 3 times, this routine makes for a great opportunity to practice mental toughness! We see common movement patterns and cover major muscle groups so it’s a great way to buckle down and refine your form and mind-to-muscle connection. You’ll see me switching out my weights for each interval and, with 20 seconds of rest between each, there should be plenty of time to do so if needed.
                    <br /><br />
                    Difficulty & Modifications Explained: This workout is rated a level 3 due to the exercises being highly scalable. Your choice of weights and whether or not you utilize the modifications shared will greatly influence the level of difficulty.
                    <br /><br />
                    Can you use the same weights in round 3 as you started with in round 1?! That’s my added challenge to you in this short and sweet workout.
