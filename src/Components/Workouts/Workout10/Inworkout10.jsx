<br /><br />



                    Welcome to Day 1 of my Pilates Challenge! I am so glad you are here, and I look forward to sharing this time with you! Today, we are focusing on core as well as lower body strength and stability. This is a fun routine with various ways to modify the exercises to make them harder or easier.
<br /><br />
                    **Workout Highlights**
<br /><br />
                    35 minutes, 3/5 difficulty <br />
                    45 seconds on // 15 seconds off<br />
                    Warm-up and cool-down included<br />
                    Scroll down for modifications<br />
                    This 35-minute workout has a 4.5 (ish) minute warm-up and a cool-down of the same length at the end. The body of the workout is about 23 minutes with 23 exercises, no repeats! Yay for #TeamBoredEasily. The warm-up is mostly standing exercises, and the workout and cool-down are all on the mat.
                    <br /><br />

                    In this routine you will notice some standard Pilates exercises such as the Hundreds, Single Leg Stretch, and Swimming. However, the further we get into the workout, the more we will switch things up with a burny side lying series for our hips to a fun balance challenge in a side plank.
                    <br /><br />

                    Since this is a Pilates-based routine, I want to mention the rib-to-hip connection. That means engaging your abdominals to bring your ribs closer to your hips or pelvis without rounding forward or arching your spine backward. Keep your spine straight, chest up, and rib cage down. When the ribs and hips are "connected," you are in a neutral spine position.
                    <br /><br />

                    Here are some suggestions for modifications:
                    <br /><br />

                    Half Roll Downs — keep your hands on the back of your thighs<br />
                    Roll-Ups — bend your knees; place your hands on the back of your thighs to help you.<br />
                    Hundreds — three options for leg position:<br />
                    Tabletop<br /><br />
                    Knees straight, toes up to the ceiling<br />
                    Legs straight on the 45-degree angle<br />
                    Side Plank Waist Wrap — keep your top leg lifted to challenge your balance<br />
                    Bridge Leg Lift — only lift your leg as high as you can to keep your hips and pelvis stable<br />
