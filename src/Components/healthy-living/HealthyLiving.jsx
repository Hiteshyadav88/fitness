            <p className='font-bold' >For all of us, making healthy choices isn’t always easy. And we all want to be informed so we can make the best choices. Here are some reminders to help keep us on track.
<br /><br />

                What should I eat to have a healthy diet?
                <br /><br />

                Eat less sugars, simple carbohydrates, trans fats, and saturated fats.
                <br /><br />

                Eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.
                <br /><br />

                Eat together as a family—share mealtime with the people you define as family.
                <br /><br />

                If you have a medical condition that requires a special diet, be sure to follow it.
                <br /><br />

                If you're over 50 years old, consider taking calcium and vitamin D.
                <br /><br />

                If you're pregnant (or thinking of becoming pregnant), take prenatal vitamins.
                <br /><br />



                How much exercise and sleep should I try to get?
                <br /><br />

                Do 30 to 60 minutes of exercise (aerobic and resistance) appropriate for your age and medical condition at least 3 times a week.
                <br /><br />

                Walk more—and take the stairs.
                <br /><br />

                Get at least 6 to 10 hours of sleep every day.
                <br /><br />

                Keep your sleep schedule as regular as possible.
                <br /><br />



                How can I try to avoid getting sick?
                <br /><br />

                Wash your hands before eating and cooking.
                <br /><br />

                Store, prepare, and cook foods (particularly meats) appropriately.
                <br /><br />

                Drink only clean or treated water.
                <br /><br />

                Wash minor wounds with soap and water and keep them covered.
                <br /><br />

                Use appropriate clothing and insect repellent when mosquito or tick exposure is likely.
                <br /><br />

                Practice safe sex.
                <br /><br />



                How can I try to avoid getting injured?
                <br /><br />

                Wear a seatbelt; if you're a child, use a car seat.
                <br /><br />

                Wear a helmet while riding a bicycle or motorcycle and use other protective gear as appropriate for the activity (recreation or occupation).
                <br /><br />

                Don't operate vehicles or power equipment while intoxicated, overly sleepy, or distracted.
                <br /><br />

                Wear a life vest while boating, don't dive into shallow water, and learn to swim.
                <br /><br />

                Store and handle firearms safely.
                <br /><br />

                Set up a safe home – make indoors and outdoors safe for children and older adults and have working smoke and carbon monoxide detectors.
                <br /><br />



                How do I keep my mind healthy?
                <br /><br />

                Keep your mind active—do word puzzles or Sudoku, read, play cards, or do a jigsaw puzzle.
                <br /><br />

                If you feel stressed or depressed, tell a loved one or a health care provider.
                <br /><br />

                Limit screen time—spend the extra time socializing or go for a walk.
                <br /><br />

                Drink alcohol only in moderation or not at all.
                <br /><br />

                Don't take drugs that aren't intended to treat a medical problem. If you think you have a drug problem, ask for help.
                <br /><br />

                Build healthy relationships. If you’re in an unhealthy relationship, health care providers or local organizations can help.
                <br /><br />



                What other healthy choices should I make?
                <br /><br />

                Don't smoke (and if you do, don't smoke in bed).
                <br /><br />

                Brush your teeth at least twice a day and see a dentist regularly for cleaning and examination.
                <br /><br />

                Be cautious about sun exposure and wear sunscreen.
                <br /><br />

                See a health care provider regularly (at least once a year) for screenings and vaccinations.
                <br /><br />
