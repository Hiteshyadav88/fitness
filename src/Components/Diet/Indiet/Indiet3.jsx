                  Our nutrition and food philosophy <br />
                  Eat real whole foods: Eating foods that are as close to their natural form and that has been processed or refined as little as possible and is free from additives or other artificial substances. Limiting processed and packaged foods with a focus on foods that are fresh and close to their original form in nature. <br /><br />
                  Balanced Nutrition and Exercise: We believe in balance when it comes to nutrition and working out. You don't have to be perfect all of the time; you just need to learn to do your best, most of the time. Aiming for perfection is a great way to sabotage yourself.
                  Balanced Nutrition: This meal plan operates under the principle of teaching you how to eat nutritionally  – giving you insight on a balanced breakdown of carbohydrate, fat, and protein, as well as what portion sizes might look like when you are trying to reach or manage your bodyweight goals. Eating nutritionally is not separate from being able to listen to what our body’s telling us. This in combination with growing in awareness of our bodies internal cues.
                  Mindful Eating and building foundations for “intuitive eating”: We have created this meal plan to not only be a nutritionally balanced program but also one that teaches you to become more aware of internal cues of hunger, fullness, and cravings. <br />
                  Keeping things simple and sustainable: There are a lot of different ideas out there when it comes to nutrition, but we think ours is one of the simplest and most sustainable.
                  Learning to eat well the rest of your life <br />
                  Our goal is for you to learn how to eat well for the rest of your life - this is not a diet but a lifestyle change. This is a tool, a general guideline and an idea generating tool for you to use. We want to... <br />

                  Teach you how to meet your nutritional needs with real food – not with meal replacement shakes, powders, or supplements but with real life food. <br />
                  This particular meal plan has been built in conjunctions with registered dietitians, based largely off of the kinds of foods that we regularly include in our own personal diets. We believe in eating real, whole foods as often as possible, in order to create a diet that is nutrient dense, filling, and fully capable of supporting an active lifestyle.
<br /><br />
