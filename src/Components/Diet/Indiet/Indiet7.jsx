You rarely pay them much attention. Before you dismiss them as boring, cheap and everyday food, take a few minutes to understand the benefits of eating more fruit and vegetables.

              Scientific evidence shows that those who eat a diet rich in fruit and vegetables have a lower risk of many diseases, including heart disease, stroke and certain cancers. Health promotion authorities worldwide encourage people to include more fruit and vegetables in their diet.
<br /><br />
              2. Variety Is the Key <br />
              When it comes to fruit and vegetables, we are truly spoilt for choice in Singapore. Any wet market or supermarket would have an abundant display of produce from all over the world.
<br /><br />
              While fruit and vegetables have some common nutritional values, they do differ in their actual composition. For example, some are higher in fibre, while others may provide you more vitamin C, beta-carotene or potassium. Even the different colour pigments in fruit and vegetables offer unique health benefits. So, eat a variety of these wonderful gifts of nature to ensure your wellness and health.
<br /><br />
              Nutrition experts recommend that you select different colours of fruit and vegetables: red, green, yellow/orange, white or purple - for maximum health benefits.
